# LITA-EC2-INSTANCE-SMARTSHOP-PROJECT

A SMARTSHOP Project Showing the provisioning of EC2 instance for a SmartShop in the AWS environs

## Project Mission

Develop a solution that meets SmartShop's requirements by leveraging AWS services such as EC2,
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and Identity and Access Management (IAM).

### This project explains the following:

- How I Set Up the Application Environment and ensure Access and Connectivity

- How I Set Up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Design the Network Architecture, Configure Networking Components:
  Set up Internet Gateways to allow internet access to public subnets, and
  Configure Route Tables to manage traffic flow between subnets and the internet.

- How I Configure Security Groups: Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from the internet, and
  Restrict SSH (port 22) access to my IP addresses only

- How I Implemented Security Best Practices : Use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) for an additional layer of subnet-level Security

\*How I Enable Monitoring with CloudWatch and Logging Using AWS CloudTrail to record AWS API calls for auditing.

- Documentation and Presentation : I Documented all configurations, including VPC settings, security groups, IAM roles, and
  scaling policies.

- Cost Analysis: I Provided an estimate of the monthly AWS costs and Suggested cost-optimization strategies.
